# Marcos Crespo - Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio repository! Here you'll find my Curriculum Vitae (CV) and some of my projects.

## About Me

üëâüèªData Scientist and AI Engineer: focused on Machine Learning and GenAI.

üëâüèªMathematician with MS in Statistics for Data Science at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M). 

I am motivated by working on ambitious projects, loaded with new technologies. Data Science should be a tool to achieve business and personal goals in a fast and rigorous way.

### Curriculum Vitae (CV)

You can find my latest CV in this repository. It includes details about my education, skills, work experience, and more.

### Projects

Below are some of my best projects showcasing my skills and experience in Data Science. Currently I'm working on some ambitious GenAI projects so these are mainly ML projects. Keep in touch to see future work!

1. **Logit_Regr_Optimization**
   Description:  A mix between theoretical and practical work. In this project I go through several **numerical methods** to optimize the estimation of the model parameters in a *logistic regression* model using **python**. The main objective is to explain the main characteristics and use cases of each method from a rigourous point of view. This is a complete ad extense document. Some of the technologies here showcased are: **Advanced Jupyter notebook, Numpy and Matplotlib** as well as some *Sklearn and Scipy*.

2. **Salary_2018**
   Description: Nice little project about some INE (Insituto Nacional Estad√≠stica) survey about salaries in Spain on 2018.
   It shows some **complex data acquisition** as well as some fancy data preprocessing. Some knowledge about **ggplot2** and **ggplotly** (interactive plots) is used.
   In addition, a classification approach was intended using some **Bayes Classification and Logistic regression**.

3. **Matrix chain multiplication**
   Description: A more theoretical work. Matrix chain multiplication problem is an optimization problem concerning the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of        matrices. In this document we cover some of its explanantion and implementation of the well-known dynamic programming solution. We use technologies such as advanced          RMarkdown using **tufte handouts**, compiled code using **Rcpp and RcppArmadillo** and some benchmarking.
