### Projects

Below are some of my best projects showcasing my skills and experience in Data Science:

1. **Logit_Regr_Optimization**
   Description:  A mix between theoretical and practical work. In this project I go through several **numerical methods** to optimize the estimation of the model parameters in a *logistic regression* model using **python**. The main objective is to explain the main characteristics and use cases of each method from a rigourous point of view. This is a complete ad extense document. Some of the technologies here showcased are: **Advanced Jupyter notebook, Numpy and Matplotlib** as well as some *Sklearn and Scipy*.

2. **Salary_2018**
   Description: Nice little project about some INE (Insituto Nacional Estad√≠stica) survey about salaries in Spain on 2018.
   It shows some **complex data acquisition** as well as some fancy data preprocessing. Some knowledge about **ggplot2** and **ggplotly** (interactive plots) is used.
   In addition, a classification approach was intended using some **Bayes Classification and Logistic regression**.

3. **Matrix chain multiplication**
   Description: A more theoretical work. Matrix chain multiplication problem is an optimization problem concerning the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of        matrices. In this document we cover some of its explanantion and implementation of the well-known dynamic programming solution. We use technologies such as advanced          RMarkdown using **tufte handouts**, compiled code using **Rcpp and RcppArmadillo** and some benchmarking.
