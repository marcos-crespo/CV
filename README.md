### Projects

Below are some of my best projects showcasing my skills and experience in Data Science:

1. **Salary_2018**
   Description: Nice little project about some INE (Insituto Nacional Estad√≠stica) survey about salaries in Spain on 2018.
   It shows some *complex data acquisition* as well as some fancy data preprocessing. Some knowledge about ggplot2 and ggplotly (interactive plots) is used.
   In addition, a classification approach was intended using some Bayes Classification and Logistic regression.
